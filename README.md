# Thread-Safe-Malloc
• Implemented memory allocation functions (malloc and free) from the C standard library in C with the linked list data structure.
• Improved space utilization of heap by splitting and merging adjacent memory blocks.
• Improved time efficiency by making functions thread-safe with pthread library and synchronization primitives.
• Experimented the first-fit search vs best-fit search malloc strategies, locking vs non-locking thread-safe strategies, and evaluated tradeoffs.
